# Profit Room Skills

**Claude Code skills that help you build an offer, land your first customers, and make content that sells.**

Built for people who can *build* with AI but haven't yet *sold* with it. You don't need to code. You run a skill in plain English, answer a couple of questions, and get a real, usable result — an offer you can pitch, an outreach list, a week of posts, a thumbnail, a landing page.

There are 51 skills across six packs. Install the whole thing or just the pack you need.

---

## Install (the one-command way)

Inside Claude Code, add this marketplace once:

```
/plugin marketplace add duncan-buildroom/profit-room-skills
```

Then install any pack:

```
/plugin install money
/plugin install content
/plugin install youtube
/plugin install media
/plugin install design
/plugin install utility
```

That's it. The skills show up in your `/` menu, and Claude will also reach for them on its own when you describe what you want. Update anytime with `/plugin marketplace update`.

> New to this? A "skill" is a saved set of instructions Claude Code already knows how to run. You don't install software — you just tell Claude what you want ("build me an offer", "write my LinkedIn post") and it uses the right skill.

### Or copy it manually

Prefer to do it by hand?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duncan-buildroom/profit-room-skills.git
cp -r profit-room-skills/skills/offer-builder ~/.claude/skills/
```

Copy any skill folder from `skills/` into your `~/.claude/skills/` directory and restart Claude Code.

## First: make the skills yours

Run this once before anything else:

```
/personalize
```

It asks a few quick questions — your name, what you do, who you serve, your offer, your voice — and saves a short **brand profile** to `~/.claude/brand-profile.md`. Every content, YouTube, and money skill reads that profile, so they all write in *your* voice for *your* audience without you re-explaining yourself each time. If a skill ever needs something the profile doesn't have, it asks and saves your answer. Run `/personalize` again anytime to update it.

Nothing you enter leaves your machine, and no skill will ever invent facts, results, or numbers about you.

## Some skills need a key

The writing and planning skills work out of the box. A few of the media and publishing skills use outside tools (image/video generation, schedulers, Notion, etc.). Each of those has a **Requirements** note telling you exactly what to set up — and if it isn't set, the skill still does the useful part and tells you what's missing. Nothing here ships with anyone's account or keys baked in.
